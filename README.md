# Desktop JP Translator

A real-time, on-screen caption translator designed to bridge language gaps in virtual meetings and other applications.

## About The Project

Have you ever been in a meeting, especially with native Japanese speakers, and struggled to keep up with the conversation? This project was born from that exact challenge.

**Desktop JP Translator** is a desktop application that captures on-screen text from any application (like Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, or video players) and provides real-time translations. Its primary goal is to help users understand the context of conversations happening in a language they are not yet fluent in, such as Japanese (Nihongo).

This tool aims to empower individuals in multicultural teams and international meetings, ensuring that language is a bridge, not a barrier.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Translation:** Captures and translates text as it appears on your screen.
- **On-Screen Overlay:** Displays translations in a convenient, non-intrusive overlay.
- **Application Agnostic:** Works with any application that displays text captions.
